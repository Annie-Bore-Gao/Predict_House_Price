# Predict_House_Price
My practice to a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques


1. removing irrelevant columns (e.g. 'ID')
2. Feature selection, data transformation (e.g. log-transform right-skewed data)
3. Feature engineering (e.g. segmented modeling)

In the process of further improving the score. 
Best RMSE: 0.128
